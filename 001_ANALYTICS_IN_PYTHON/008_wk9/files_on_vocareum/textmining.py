Question 1

Write a function that takes the file name ofa page with a list of musicians as an input, 
and returns a list of URLs that point to articles on each musician in the list.

Example of use: get_musicians("boogiewoogie.html")
The output should be a list of strings:

['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Agerbeek',
 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Ammons',
 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrews_Sisters',
 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winifred_Atwell',
 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Baldori',

"""
Question 3

Use the Learning Sample in the samples folder to construct an LSI model. 
Then, use the LSI model to find the most similar musician from the learning sample 
(folder 'samples') for each musician in the test sample (folder 'test'). Then, save in a CSV
the name of a musician from the test sample, and the name of the most similar musician 
from the learning sample.

Example of output (don't forget the header):

TestName,SampleName
MelvinSparks,HenryGraymusician
RooseveltSykes,RooseveltSykes
BillyEckstine,FatsDomino
JimmyWitherspoon,MoonMullican

    # This function can be quite long!

    # Hint: You should create a dataframe df with two columns,
    # TestName, SampleName
    # then dump this dataframe in a csv with the code:
    # 
    # df.to_csv('output.csv',index=False)
