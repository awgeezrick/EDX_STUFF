    "Probability is the study of the observations that are generated by sampling from a known distribution. The statistical methods we have studied so far allow us to reason about the world from data. Probability allows us to reason in the opposite directions: what observations result from know facts about the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, we rarely know precisely how random processes in the world work. Even the simplest random process such as [flipping a coin](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~susan/papers/headswithJ.pdf) is not as simple as one might assume. Nonetheless, our ability to reason about what data will result from a known random process is useful in many aspects of data science. Fundamentally, the rules of probability allow us to reason about the consequences of assumptions we make."

    "Probability uses the following vocabulary to describe the relationship between known distributions and their observed outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Experiment**: An occurrence with an uncertain outcome that we can observe. For example, the result of rolling two dice in sequence.\n",
    "- **Outcome**: The result of an experiment; one particular state of the world. For example: the first die comes up 4 and the second comes up 2. This outcome could be summarized as `(4, 2)`.\n",
    "- **Sample Space**: The set of all possible outcomes for the experiment. For example, `{(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), ..., (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 2), ... (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)}` are all possible outcomes of rolling two dice in sequence. There are `6 * 6 = 36` different outcomes.\n",
    "- **Event**: A subset of possible outcomes that together have some property we are interested in. For example, the event \"the two dice sum to 5\" is the set of outcomes {(1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 1)}.\n",
    "- **Probability**: The proportion of experiments for which the event occurs. For example, the probability that the two dice sum to 5 is `4/36` or `1/9`.\n",
    "- **Distribution**: The probability of all events.\n",
    "\n",
    "The important part of this terminology is that the *sample space* is the set of all *outcomes*, and an *event* is a subset of the sample space. For an outcome that is an element of an event, we say that it is an outcome for which that event occurs."
