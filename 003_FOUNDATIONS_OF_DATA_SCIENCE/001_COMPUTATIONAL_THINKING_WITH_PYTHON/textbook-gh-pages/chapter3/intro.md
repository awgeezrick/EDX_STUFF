Sampling
========

Sampling is a powerful computational technique in data analysis. It allows us
to investigate both issues of probability and statistics. *Probability* is the
study of the outcomes of random processes; processes that include chance.
*Statistics* is just the opposite: it is the study of random processes given
observations of their outcomes. Put another way, probability focuses on what
will be observed given what we know about the world. Statistics focuses on
what we can infer about the world given what we have observed. Random Sampling
is a central tool in both directions of inference.
